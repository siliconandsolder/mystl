# mystl
#### A collection of custom STL containers, remade as an exercise in writing C++.

This is simply a collection of four common STL containers (vector, set, list, and map) rewritten by me as an exercise in writing C++ programmes. As of right now, only the vector is available. Everything here was compiled using the Visual C++ compiler; I have not tested this with the g++ compiler.
